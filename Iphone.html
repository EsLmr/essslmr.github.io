Among the innovations of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were: a new-generation processor, a doubling of RAM to 2 GB, and a 12-megapixel camera. 3D Touch technology was also integrated into the 6s model for the first time. In addition, this smartphone boasted a modified and significantly faster version of Touch ID, Apple's fingerprint sensor.</p>

It combined the form factor of the iPhone 5s, which many buyers missed, and the technical filling of the iPhone 6s, but it was even cheaper than the "full" iPhone 6s (Plus). But manufacturers saved on the front-facing camera, which was significantly inferior to the cameras of its predecessor, which was a significant disadvantage for users of FaceTime technology. In addition, the fingerprint sensor, which in the iPhone 6s was already in the second version, the SE was in the slower first version.</p>

The IPhone 7 Plus, a larger-screen version, was also equipped with a dual camera. According to Apple, this combination of a wide-angle and telephoto lens should produce a result similar to that of a SLR camera. In addition, the iPhone 7 l started a trend that many users still can't accept: the disappearance of the headphone Jack. This iPhone was the first smartphone that no longer had room for the classic 3.5 mm Jack. This trend can be traced to this day: modern flagships also come out without such a connector.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">In the Jet Black variant, the new iPhone 7 was also the first model to support wireless charging according to the Qi standard. In addition, the iPhone 7 was the first model that did not have a physical "Home"button.

The design again hasn't changed too much compared to its predecessor, but the phone looks better with a glass and aluminum case. The IPhone 7 with this combination of materials could only be purchased in Jet Black (black onyx). This is why Apple faced problems in the market after the release of the new model. The new True Tone Display should guarantee the user better screen image quality. To do this, the smartphone constantly analyzes the environment and adjusts the color rendering of the display in accordance with the current lighting conditions. In both versions of the iPhone 8, the phone provides the necessary power with the A11 Bionic SoC processor.</p>

But the new model was only available in November 2017. This time, the device's design was significantly improved: the phone's appearance was now defined by stainless steel and glass, as well as the so-called "Super Retina HD Display" from Apple with rounded corners that better follow the shape of the phone than it was in previous models.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <p class="width  size">On the front panel, Apple first installed a display almost without borders, which is quite similar to the concepts of displays of the most current iPhone models today: there are no frames, but the "bangs" (cutout) immediately catches the eye at the top of the display. And here the iPhone X again became the founder of a new trend, which is followed by many smartphone manufacturers who decorate the displays of their new models with different cutout shapes. But, it should be noted, the appearance of such "bangs" has its own reason: iPhone X is the first smartphone that can be unlocked using Face ID technology, which uses a 3D model of your face. For this purpose, appropriate infrared sensors and cameras are provided. This method of unlocking using Face ID is much more secure than the 2D recognition that was common at the time.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">With the Face ID system, functions such as Emojis and then Memojis became possible for the first time. An innovation that users had to get used to for some time: due to the new type of display on the front panel of the device, there is no space left for the "Home" button, which is familiar for other Apple devices» Instead, from the iPhone X to the present day, all new Apple phones retain gesture control. In addition, the iPhone X, like the iPhone 8, runs on an A11-Bionic-SoC processor, which provides the necessary performance. Another innovation — five preset effects for getting beautiful portrait images using the main and front cameras.</p>

It is equipped with all technical innovations with a few exceptions, and the price is quite attractive. The 6.1-inch screen in the rating is roughly between the XS and XS Max displays. However, Apple does not rely on the OLED display, but on the LCD technology. Many users were disappointed with the low resolution of the display, which is approximately up to HD. For the 2018 Apple smartphone, this was no longer modern. While the processor of the new model is similar to the XS series processor, the XR has to settle for less memory per Gigabyte. In addition, the main memory was not as configurable as the XS models.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">On the back of the XR series models, there is no second camera lens, which on the iPhone XS (Max) provides zoom without loss of quality. The display edges of this model are slightly wider, but the user also has gesture control at their disposal. the iPhone XR made it possible for customers to purchase an Apple phone in a modern design for less money. But in any case, the retail price of the new model was very high, not lower than that of other flagships of 2018.</p>

Two of them were: iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Starting from September 20, new iPhone models went on sale. The display size is 5.8 inches (iPhone 11 Pro) and 6.5 inches (iPhone 11 Pro Max). The Pro and Pro Max models use a 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera in addition to a 12-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera. With the new night mode, even when shooting in the dark, you should get good photos.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">Buyers still argue about cameras on the back of a smartphone: their location definitely resembles a spinner. Inside the iPhone, the A13 Bionic processor works, this is the next generation of processors, after those of the iPhone XR and XS. Starting from the eleventh generation, 3D-Touch technology is no longer available. For the Pro models of the eleventh generation of the iPhone, Apple is using frosted glass as the material of the back panel for the first time. Thanks to this, phones make a much more noble impression.</p>
