The California giant has already enlisted the support of startups ServiceMax (creates software for field customer service) and PlanGrid (offers a service for working with construction drawings). Apple is also discussing the possibility of working with some other manufacturers of business software. ServiceMax marketing Director Stacey Epstein says that about 95% of Her company's customers use Apple devices, and each new customer usually orders thousands of iPhones and iPads. According to Epstein, the corporate environment represents a very big opportunity for Apple's growth, since the volume of only one market FOR customer service in the field is $15 billion.
                                    According to Reuters reviewers, in the corporate market, Apple wants to follow the model chosen when selling smartphones to consumers. First, the company will attract customers through software and content, and then start selling them devices that bring the manufacturer the lion's share of profits.</p>

                                          <p class="width  size">On October 12, 2017, Apple received the green light to build a new data center in Ireland two years after the project was announced. They even held rallies in support of him.
                                          In February 2015, Apple announced plans to deploy a data center in the city of Athenry in the West of Ireland. This place was not chosen by chance: nearby are renewable energy sources, which Apple has long been striving to use everywhere.
                                          Six months after the project was announced, the Atenray municipal Council approved it, but there were people who saw the new data center as an environmental threat and other problems. Applications were submitted to the Supreme court of Ireland seeking a ban on the construction of a computing platform.</p>
                                    </div>


                                    <p class="width  size">Only on October 12, 2017, judge Paul McDermott (Paul McDermott) made a decision, it turned out in favor of Apple. Now the company can start creating a data center, which is planned to invest 850 billion euros (about $1 billion).
                                      Apple was going to simultaneously run two data center — in Athenree and Denmark. The Danish project will be completed by the end of 2017, but the Irish project has been delayed. The decision of the Supreme court of Ireland was expected in July, but due to a shortage of judges, the case was postponed to October.
                                      In September, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met with Apple executives, who said that the us company was disappointed with the court delays, and warned that the results of this incident could affect future investment.
                                      The Irish government has announced possible amendments to legislation that will add data centers to the list of strategic infrastructure, which will allow them to go through the planning process faster.
                                      The Irish economy is heavily dependent on foreign international companies, which employ one in ten people in the country. The government supports the construction of data centers and other major projects of foreign players to expand the presence of these companies in the local market.
                                      After Apple ran into problems building a data center in Ireland, the company announced plans to build another data center in Denmark. Whether the California giant will do this after getting permission from the Irish court is not specified.
                                      According to Apple's plans, its data center in Athenray will be located on an area of more than 202 hectares and will occupy eight buildings. Part of the discontent among critics of the project was that the company's data storage and processing facility would be built on the territory of a forestry owned by a state-owned firm.
                                      Apple's initiative was supported by thousands of local residents who took to the streets, demanding a permit for the California giant. This data center is considered one of the largest investment projects in the West of Ireland. Thanks to it, about 300 builders will get jobs, and about 150 permanent jobs will be created at the facility itself.</p>

Second, Apple has provided jobs for several thousand people in the city of cork, a two-hour drive from Athenry.
                                            In addition, Apple uses Ireland to significantly reduce the tax burden. In 2016, the European Commission fined Apple 13 billion euros for tax evasion "under the Irish scheme". However, the Irish authorities claim that the Corporation paid taxes in full and did not receive any preferences from the government.</p>

                                      Apple, according to a press release, is concerned about the problem of rapidly rising real estate prices, because of which teachers, firefighters, ambulance workers and service providers are increasingly forced to leave the Silicon valley area.
