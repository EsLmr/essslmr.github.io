                                    <p class="width  size">The iMac model range includes several generations of devices that have both visual and technical differences. With the introduction of the tenth version of Apple's operating system, Mac OS X, in 2000, it became necessary to create an appropriate computer that met both the requirements of the operating system and the requirements of the market.</p>



                                    <p class="width  size">The first iMac model with Mac OS X pre-installed was the iMac G4, which received a flat 15” LCD screen with a resolution of 1024 x 768 and a Power PC processor with a frequency of 700 MHz. Initially, the iMac G4 was shipped with two operating systems - Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, but since February 2003, the iMac lineup has been supplemented by a computer that did not have the ninth version of the operating system. In addition, the new model received a more spacious hard drive of 80 GB.</p>



                                    <p class="width  size">In total, in November 2003, Apple released four iMac G4 models, adding support for USB-2.0, a 1.25 GHz processor in the maximum configuration, and two options with widescreen displays: 17” 1440 x 900 and 20” 1680 x 1050.</p>

                                   <p class="width  size">All the inside of the device, with the exception of the speakers, was located in a massive round case that served as a stand for the monitor. The iMac G4 was equipped with external speakers, an Apple Pro Keyboard and an Apple Pro Mouse. The computer was produced until mid-2004</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">In 2007, the iMac received a recognizable aluminum body and improved technical characteristics, generally almost identical to the plastic version. The back cover was not removable, and the number of USB ports increased to four. The only fire-Wire 400 port is also missing.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">The iMac model range lost a computer with a 17” screen, the Intel Core 2 Duo processor received a standard frequency of 2.0 GHz, and the amount of RAM increased to 1 GB. In the version with a 24 " IPS screen, these numbers were 2.4 GHz and 2 GB, respectively. In both cases, it was possible to install 4 GB of RAM.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <p class="width  size">In the last, 2009 year of production, the processor frequency ranged from 2.66 GHz to 3.06 GHz, and the maximum configuration got 8 GB of RAM and graphics nVidia GeForce GT 130 512 MB (or similar ATI Radeon HD 4850) regardless of the diagonal.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">The hard drive capacity started at 250 GB for the 20” and 320 GB for the 24” version. For 2009 models, these figures were 320 GB and 640 GB, respectively. In all cases, the maximum hard disk space was 1 TB.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">The computer was equipped with a wired keyboard and Apple Mighty Mouse. The iMac Aluminum pre-installed the operating system version 10.6 "Snow Leopard". If you have 2 GB of RAM, your computer supports all current versions of the system, including Mac OS 10.10 "Yosemite". The computer was on sale until the end of 2009.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">At the end of 2009, the iMac model range received a major update again. The computer got a Unibody case and a different aspect ratio of the screen - now it is 16:9 instead of 16: 10. At the same time, the diagonal and resolution changed, these indicators correspond to 1920 x 1080 for 21.5” and 2560 x 1440 for 27” and are still relevant.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">The Junior model was equipped with a dual-core Intel Core 2 Duo processor with a frequency of 3.06 GHz to 3.33 GHz, while the maximum configuration of the iMac 27” received a Quad-core Intel Core i7 at 2.8 GHz.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">The amount of RAM and expansion slots doubled to 4 GB and 16 GB in the maximum configuration, the 27” model supports expansion to 32 GB of RAM (at the stated 16).</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">In 2010, the younger iMac model received a Core i3 processor with a frequency of 3.06 GHz, and in mid-2011, all computer models were equipped with Intel Core i5 processors made using Sandy Bridge technology, and the ability to replace it with Intel Core i7.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">Almost all unibody iMacs from late 2009 to mid-2011 had ATI Radeon 4000, 5000 and 6000 series graphics installed. The average amount of video memory was from 256 MB to 512 MB, while the maximum configuration in mid-2011 included ATI Radeon HD 6970M at 2 GB.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">For the 21.5” and 27” versions of the computer, the hard disk capacity was 500 GB and 1 TB, respectively. In both cases, it was possible to install a 2 TB hard drive, and the iMac 27” 2011 for the first time allowed you to install a 256 GB SSD.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">For the first time Apple began to equip its computers with wireless input devices Apple Wireless Keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse (instead of a mouse, the user could choose Apple Magic Trackpad). iMac Unibody was released until the end of 2012.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">The computer was shipped with the “10.6 Snow Leopard " operating system pre-installed.

                                    <p class="width  size">In November 2012, the design of the iMac underwent another visual change - significantly reduced the thickness of the edges of the computer case. In this regard, the disk drive slot disappeared from the right side, and the card reader was moved to the back of the case.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">All computer models have an Intel Core i5 processor that can be replaced with an Intel Core i7.
