This is how the first iPad appeared-an intermediate link between a laptop and a smartphone, with a 9.7-inch multi-touch screen and a resolution of 1028 × 768 pixels (132 ppi).</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">The first iPad had a single-core Apple A4 processor with a frequency of 1 GHz and 256 MB of RAM, which looks very sad by today's standards. The tablet had no cameras at all, although iOS 4, which it supported, already provided the ability to make video calls over FaceTime.</p>

But in March 2011, Apple introduced a new version of the iPad, in the description of which you can find a lot of numbers "2". the iPad 2 Processor became 2-core, RAM was installed 2 times more (512 MB), there were 2 cameras with a resolution of 0.3 and 0.7 MP. In addition, Cellular models now supported the more popular MicroSIM cards, instead of the bulky standard ones.</p>

                                    <p class="width  size">In 2012, Apple also released a modified version of the iPad 2 with an extended battery life, which was achieved by an improved Apple A5 processor (manufactured using a 32-nm process) and a more capacious battery.</p>

The main thing, from the point of view of the evolution of the model range, was the appearance of the new iPad 8-pin lightning port (previously used a wide 30-pin), which is used for charging and syncing iOS devices to this day. In addition, the iPad 4 is equipped with a faster Apple a6x processor and a PowerVR SGX 554MP4 graphics core, as well as a front-facing FaceTime camera with a 1.2 MP matrix. In February 2013, the iPad 4 was released with 128 GB of internal memory.</p>
