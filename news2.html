                        <h2>Apple will release four iPhones with 5G network</h2>
                        <img class="width border" src="assets/img/n2.png" alt="">
                        <p></p>
                        <p class="width  size">Apple will launch a new line of iPhone 12 smartphones with unique features this year. The most important thing is that there will be more mobile phones themselves, because if there were three new models in 2019, now the trio will turn into a Quartet.
                        Each of the iPhone 12 series smartphones will receive support for fifth-generation cellular networks that provide high-speed Internet access, as you can see on the Speedcheck Internet Speed Test website after their release. This service is for measuring the speed there as in the web version, and in the form of separate mobile apps. The younger representative of the line will get an aluminum case and a screen of 5.4 inches diagonally, meaning it will be a very tiny iPhone-only the outdated iPhone 8 and iPhone SE of the first and only generation are smaller than it. This smartphone will have two cameras.</p>
                        <p class="width  size">The next representative of the Quartet is the iPhone 12 with a 6.1-inch screen, also made of aluminum and also with two cameras. These are low-cost mobile phones, unlike the other two, which received a stainless steel case and four cameras at once, one of which is lidar. Apple has been integrating this sensor into its mobile devices since March 2020, when the new iPad Pro 2020 tablet was released, and it is needed for better performance of augmented reality applications.</p>
                        <p class="width  size">All four iPhone 12s will get the latest 5-nanometer A14 processor, and this is the first chip of its kind worldwide. In other respects, mobile phones are very likely to remain unchanged â€” according to analysts ' forecasts, even the monobrow will remain, although it will become slightly smaller. In other words, we are waiting for another interpretation of the iPhone X, released three years ago, and the fourth generation of IPhones in a row with the same design. It is not yet known whether Apple will abandon the proprietary Lightning interface in favor of a more modern USB-C, as it did in the iPad Pro, but a 5G modem is guaranteed for every smartphone in the iPhone 12 series.</p>
                        <p class="width  size">Recall that last summer, Apple bought the modem division from Intel, but did not have time to prepare its 5G chips for the release of the iPhone 11. Now she had plenty of time. The only problem is that most countries do not have fifth-generation networks, and In Russia, they will not appear for at least three years. Perhaps for our market, Apple will release the iPhone 12 with a regular LTE modem. The announcement of all four new products is tentatively scheduled for September this year. Smartphone prices are unknown.</p>
